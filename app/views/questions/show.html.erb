                                <h3>Q: Can I run every device in my house with 1 purchase?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A: Not at the same time. Each purchase can only be linked to 1 MAC address (AKA device). If you wish to run every device in your home, then you will need to purchase another credit for each of those devices. For example: I have 4 devices in my home (HTPC, 2 desktop PC's, G-Box Q), therefore I will only be able to use 1 device at a time for streaming purpose. to use them all I will need to purchase 4 credits.

                                <h3>Q: What is a MAC address? Is this the same as my IP address?</h3>
                                <p>
                                  A: They are not the same. A MAC (or Machine Access Control) address is best thought of as kind of serial number assigned to every network adapter. No two anywhere should have the same MAC address. MAC addresses are typically used only to direct packets from one device to the next as data travels on a network.
                                  <p> Bottom line: your MAC address doesn’t make it out very far. Even if someone knows your MAC address, that knowledge certainly doesn’t help them do anything either good or bad.</p>

                                  <p>We have tested numerous iptv receivers but at the moment we are recommending the following boxes</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>MAG250</li>
                                  <li>MAG254 (Recommended)</li>
                                  <li>MAG260 (Works but is very unstable)</li>

                                  <p>There are many STBs compatible with this new system but we highly recommend the <strong>MAG254</strong> to make sure that the user will have the best experience. This is the one we offer when you buy our package</p>
